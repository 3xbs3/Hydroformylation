 Input file: crest_ensemble.xyz
 Number of CPU cores to be used:    2
 Note: This file will be regarded as generated by crest program because the filename contains "crest"
 
 Input the energy threshold for distinguishing different clusters
 e.g. 0.5  (in kcal/mol)
 If press ENTER button directly, 0.25 kcal/mol will be used
 
 Input the geometry threshold for distinguishing different clusters
 e.g. 0.25  (in Angstrom)
 If press ENTER button directly, 0.1 Angstrom will be used
